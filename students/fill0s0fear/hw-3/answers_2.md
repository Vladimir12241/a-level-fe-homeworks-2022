1. number. (number + number = number)
2. string (number add to string, so number implicit conversion to string)
3. string. (have `+`. every thing implicit conversion to string)
4. string. (have `+`. every thing implicit conversion to string)
5. number. (we have number and `-`. {} try to implicit converts into number. result will be NaN. Nan is a number)
6. number. (we have increment`+` before the string`a`. JS try implicit conversion string into number. result will be NaN. Nan is a number)
7. number. (we have increment`+` before the string``. JS try implicit conversion string into number. result will be 0. 0 is a number.)
8. number. (we have increment`+` before the string`-1`. JS try implicit conversion string into number. result will be `-1`. `-1` is a number.)
9. number (we have increment`+` before the object{}. try to implicit converts into number. result will be NaN. Nan is a number)
10. string (we have `+` and string. implicity converths everithing into string)
11. string (`1` is a number. `1` is supported by `+` operator. we add to a number the second argument. second argument not a number. implicity converths everything into string. result 1[object Oblect])
12. string (`[]` not a primitive. implicity converts into string. have result empty string. we have `string` and `+`. implicity converts everuthing into string. last result empty string)
13. number. (1 is a number. also we have operator`-`. string `a` implicity converts into number. result NaN. Nan is a number)
14. number. (1 is a number. also we have operator`-`. object `{}` implicity converts into number. result NaN. Nan is a number)
15. number. (`[]` not a primitive. implicity converts into string. we have empty`string` and operator`-`. impicity converts both `[]` from string into number. empty string = 0 after convertation. result is 0. 0 is a number)
